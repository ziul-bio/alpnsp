# Data Analysis for "A fold switch regulates conformation of an alphavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase"

## Overview
This repository contains the computational data analysis for the study investigating the conformational regulation of alphavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through a fold switch mechanism.

## Analysis Components
The data analysis is organized into three main Jupyter notebooks:

1. Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA)
Notebook: [DCA](https://github.com/ziul-bio/alpnsp/blob/main/notebooks/alphavirus_nsP4_DCA.ipynb)
Analysis of co-evolutionary constraints in alphavirus RdRp sequences using Direct Coupling Analysis to identify functionally important residue pairs and structural contacts.

2. Neff and V-scores Analysis
Notebook: [Neff](https://github.com/ziul-bio/alpnsp/blob/main/notebooks/alphavirus_nsP4_Neff.ipynb)
Computation of effective sequence numbers (Neff) and variability scores (V-scores) to quantify sequence diversity and conservation patterns across the multiple sequence alignment.

3. Relative Solvent Accessibility (RSA) Analysis
Notebook: [RSA](https://github.com/ziul-bio/alpnsp/blob/main/notebooks/alphavirus_nsP4_RSA.ipynb)
Calculation and analysis of relative solvent accessibility to correlate surface exposure patterns with functional and conformational switching regions.
